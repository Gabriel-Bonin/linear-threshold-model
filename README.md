## Summary
This code simulates a linear threshold model for complex networks. This model tells us how a particular nodes behaves and adopts a certain state when part of its neighbors already adopted that certain state. All the calculations and concepts are based on [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315004742). The network data belongs to a nematode (C. elegans) and was obtained from [[2]](https://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html#Connectivitydata).

This repository is part of an ongoing undergraduate research project in the Complex System Group of Unicamp, supported by CNPq scholarship [[3]](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br).
